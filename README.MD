# 🤖 AI Agents for Smart Manufacturing – AutoParts Inc.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **AI Agents** to solve real-world challenges in a smart manufacturing environment. The case study focuses on **AutoParts Inc.**, a mid-sized automotive parts manufacturer facing quality issues, machine downtime, rising labor costs, and increasing demand for customization.

The solution leverages **agent-based automation** to improve operational efficiency, decision-making, and scalability across manufacturing processes.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Reduce defect rates in precision-manufactured components
* Minimize unplanned machine downtime
* Optimize labor utilization and production scheduling
* Enable faster, data-driven responses to customer customization demands

---

## 🧠 AI Agent Architecture

The system is built using a **multi-agent approach**, where each agent has a specialized responsibility:

### 1️⃣ Quality Control Agent

* Uses anomaly detection and inspection logic to identify defective parts
* Flags defects early in the production cycle
* Continuously improves accuracy by learning from historical quality data

### 2️⃣ Predictive Maintenance Agent

* Monitors machine health signals (usage patterns, failure indicators)
* Predicts potential breakdowns before they occur
* Automatically schedules maintenance windows

### 3️⃣ Production & Scheduling Agent

* Dynamically adjusts production schedules
* Balances labor availability, machine capacity, and order priority
* Supports customization and faster delivery timelines
